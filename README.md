## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Multi-Layer Authentication
- **JWT Tokens** - 15-minute access tokens with secure refresh mechanism
- **Token Rotation** - Automatic refresh token rotation prevents replay attacks
- **Session Management** - Maximum 5 concurrent sessions per user
- **Token Reuse Detection** - Automatic session termination on security breach

### Rate Limiting Strategy
```typescript
// Multiple rate limiting policies
- auth-email: 10 requests per 5 minutes (by email + IP)
- ip-only: 20 requests per minute (by IP)
- email-only: 5 requests per minute (by authenticated user)
- Global: 1000 requests per hour (by IP)
```

### Data Protection
- **Email Confirmation** - Required for account activation
- **Two-Factor Authentication** - Email-based 2FA with 15-minute expiration
- **Password Requirements** - Strong password policy with validation
- **CORS Configuration** - Restricted origins for production security
